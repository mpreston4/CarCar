## Sales microservice

The sales microservice is responsible for keeping track of automobile sales that come from the inventory microservice. There is cross communication between the sales microservice and inventory microservice which allows us to ensure that sales are only being generated by vehicles that come from inventory's microservice. This is done by pulling data from the "Automobiles" model that lives within the inventory microservice's models. The sales polls the "sold" and "vin" properties from the inventory microservice every 60 seconds to stay as up to date as possible with the current list of automobiles.

Since data is polled from the inventory microservice, there is an AutomobileVO (automobile value object) that lives within the sales microservice and holds the data for the fields "sold" and "vin". In addition to AutomobileVO, there are Salesperson, Customer, and Sale models within the "sales" microservice. These models in conjunction with the API endpoints are ultimately set up to handle requests from users allowing them to add a customer, salesperson, and sale to their collection. In addition to creating, the user can retrieve a list of all of the customers, salespeople, and sales if they click on links that are provided in the navbar. The database is up using PostgresSQL which is updated whenever a user creates a new instance wihtin one of the models. The view functions were added to send out data, based on the API endpoint, in a JSON formatted string, with Insomnia as the UI for back end testing. The Sale model in particular has a foreign key relationship with Customer, Salesperson, and AutomobileVO, so that when a user creates a sale, they can assign that sale to an existing customer, salesperson, and automobile.

Once all of the back end models were set up, and view fuctions were created to handle the requests, the front end was built using React and Javascript. As previously mentioned, the user can click on a link which will display either a list page, or a create page for one of the models (Customer, Salesperson, or Sale). The fields wihtin the create forms, once submitted, are reset which allows the user to stay on the form and continue adding people without having to refresh or switch back to the create page. Additionally, there is a page set up for sales history, which allows the user to view all of the sales that were made by a particular salesperson.
